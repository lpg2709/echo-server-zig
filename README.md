# echo-server-zig

Simple TCP echo server write in [Zig 0.11.0](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.11.0)

Because Zig is not yet finalized, there are a lot of changes in the standard
library, for this reason I locked this example in version 0.11.0 of the language
```

## Usage

```sh
zig build run

Test the code:
