# echo-server-zig

Simple TCP echo server write in [Zig 0.12.0](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.12.0)

**Note:**

```
Because Zig is not yet finalized, there are a lot of changes in the standard
library, for this reason I locked this example in version 0.12.0 of the language
```

You can see changes between versions by comparing branches.

> Each new version of Zig is separated by branches.

```sh
zig build run
